# psicasso
psicasso is a cognitive model to simulate the dynamics of aesthetic appreciation.

# Background
The so-called cycle of preference (Carbon, 2010) is characteristic for many domains (e.g., music, fashion, industrial  design): Aesthetic  appreciation is dynamically changing over years and decades. Carbon demonstrates that different features of car exteriors –- particularly curvature -– vary over time and correlate with liking.

The model proposed here is mainly based on the psi-theory from Dörner (2001) and on Hintzmans (1988) MINERVA2 memory model. 
According to Dörner’s theory, aesthetic appreciation is a form of satisfaction of needs in two ways:
- Direct: Reduction of uncertainty by “understanding” form and content of the visual configuration, e. g. recognizing familiar structures or objects 
- Associative: Retrospection or anticipation of a satisfaction which is a weakened form of satisfaction
Concentrating on the first factor (direct satisfaction) we assume to have a key mechanism to simulate the
changing appreciation. Hintzmans model is essential here for processing, storing and retrieving visual
information
